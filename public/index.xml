      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <description>Breezy - A pneumatic experiment Breezy is a product designed to help people with scars to care for their neck health and ear health.
“Scar” is always associated closly with illness, tor- ture, shame, and the past. And it will gradually become a symbolic long-term existence as time goes by, which also bring people with sad and unbearable memories. People, es- pecially young women who are left with scars often become unconfident and low self-esteem.</description>

      <description>Weed - A portable lamp design Weed is an easy-charging lighting product which aims at “providing users with agile and convenient lighting”. At the same time, by using the traditional Chinese imagery it arises people’s emotions towards nature and connects this feeling together with people’s daily lives.
My inspiration comes from early childhood. The dogtail grass (毛毛草) is the most memorial part in Chinese people’s early lives. During when children often ran outdoor with it in their hands.</description>

      <description>Ori - AR platform design “ORI” is an AR glasses product for tourists based on commercial cultural travel scenarios. During the whole developing process, I mainly participated in the concept development stage, ideation, model making, prototyping and rendering output.
The previous version of product was a bit heavy, hard to manipulate (adjust the band length etc.), complex structure. After some consideration we decided to make a “lighter” version, which only includes a optical module, a main chip and two amplifiers.</description>
