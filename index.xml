      <description>Hi,
/ This is Jinying.
/ &amp;hellip;
/ I communicate through &amp;ldquo;Practice&amp;rdquo;.
/ Here i record my way of thinking, of exploring and experienmenting the real world almost every day, and the process is still on going.
/ To me, &amp;ldquo;design&amp;rdquo; is more about a tool of trying to seek and spot the problem, and searching for an unexpected solution. Through all kinds of media - no matter through sketches, through physical product, or through animation, through performance or photography, they are all my methods of &amp;ldquo;expressing the solution to a certain outcome&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
