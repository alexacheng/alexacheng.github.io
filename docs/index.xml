      <description>Hi,
/ This is Jinying.
/ &amp;hellip;
/ I communicate through &amp;ldquo;Practice&amp;rdquo;.
/ Here i record my way of thinking, of exploring and experienmenting the real world almost every day, and the process is still on going.
/ To me, &amp;ldquo;design&amp;rdquo; is more about a tool of trying to seek and spot the problem, and searching for an unexpected solution. Through all kinds of media - no matter through sketches, through physical product, or through animation, through performance or photography, they are all my methods of &amp;ldquo;expressing the solution to a certain outcome&amp;rdquo;.</description>
