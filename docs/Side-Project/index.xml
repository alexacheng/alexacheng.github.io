      <description>/ A 4-week CAID course during the study in Umeå Institute of Design. During the CAID courses we attended lessons on digital surface modelling and visualization and rendering software. The 4-week course consists of lectures and practical training and is carried out under teacher guidance.
/ We were asked to select our own product to model, which i chose the Sony headset. The most difficult part was to model the joint surface.</description>
